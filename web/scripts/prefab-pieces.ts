// tsx scripts/prefab-pieces.ts <pieces.json>: brings the piece tables up to the game's editor
// after an update. Every menu piece is added to lib/prefab-pieces.ts, which the upload check
// (lib/prefab-check.ts) takes; each menu piece's mesh in lib/prefab-meshes.ts is set to the one
// the game draws it from (its Main component's when that is a solid a player sees, else the
// first such component's, else none: a light or a decal, left out of the picture); and each mesh
// those name that the tables lack gets its bounds and the stand-in closest to its outlines
// (scripts/prefab-pieces/fit.ts), with its outline in lib/prefab-profiles.ts when it is drawn
// from one. Entries already there are kept, and no piece is ever taken out of the known ones.
//
// <pieces.json> is the piece catalogue that ballest-map-making/extract/pieces/ reads from the
// game's own packages (the editor's DT_MapItems table and its category data assets, with each
// piece's mesh components and each mesh's bounds, and its render geometry in
// geometry/<mesh>.json beside it). It stays local: only the numbers below come into the repo
// (ADR 0001). Each table is written out whole, sorted, under its header comment, and Prettier
// lays it out; the files are then read back to check they hold what was meant.

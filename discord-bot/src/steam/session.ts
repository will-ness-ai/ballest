// A logged-in Steam session and the three leaderboard reads the bot needs.
//
// Three facts shape this file:
// - Leaderboard requests must go ONE AT A TIME. With several in flight, Steam silently drops
//   replies (10% lost at 10 concurrent, 50% at 50). A dropped reply never calls back, so every
//   request has its own timeout and is retried. (The spikes, issue #21, 2026-09-24.)
// - Find-by-name only works with the message header's routing_appid set to the app. (Same.)
// - steam-user's own reconnect after a dropped connection can fail silently and for good: on
//   2026-10-06 the bot lost Steam at 22:09 UTC and every read of a live Lobby failed until it
//   ended. So once requests have gone unanswered, or the client has been logged off, for
//   FRESH_LOGON_AFTER_MS, the session logs on again with a new client.
